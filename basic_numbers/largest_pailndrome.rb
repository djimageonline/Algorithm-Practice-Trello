# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


# num1 = 100
# num2 = 101


# sum = num1 + num2
# we increase num2 by 1 each time until we hit 1000 then
# we increase num1 by 1 (up to 1000) by 1 and repeat num1 + num2 = sum until we hit 1000
# convert the sum to a string and check to see if string in reverse is the same
# if it is palindrome store it as the current palindrome
# if the revere string is the same we have to check and see if the current palindrome higher than the new one.
# return the max palindrome

# sum = num1 + num2
# palindrome = 0
# index = 100
# index < 1000
# convert the sum to a string and check to see if string in reverse is the same
# if the revere string is the same we have to check and see if the current palindrome higher than the new one.
# while that increases until the palindron is found
